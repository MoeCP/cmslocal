Passionate Adv ASD
I am a mother of an 8 yr old child with Autism and Sensory Integration Dysfunction.  My education goes beyond classroom lectures.  I have researched on my own all childhood behavioral disorders.  I am knowledgable in education for the special needs, behavior strategies for a problem child, federal legislation IDEA, DoD Initiatives, Child Find and military resources as well as orgainizational.
With a global rate of diagnosis 1 in 110 Autism is in many ways an epidemic.  Military children are at a disadvantage due to lifestyle as well as the ratio at 1 in 88 kids.  Department of Defense has done great things and leads the campaign to provide quality care and sesrvices but there is not much awareness and education out there.  
To effectively teach a child to become verbal requires many skills that I am now an expert:  debate, asking a question in many forms until they understand, vocabulary, one directional to multiy directional directions, visual scheduling, verbal commands, non-authoratative parenting and speech.
