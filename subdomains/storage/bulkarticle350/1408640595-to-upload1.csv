5 Ways to Get the Best Hotel Deals,H-14-8373-219610,"<p>1Finding a cheap hotel means being able to splurge during other parts of your vacation. While saving money is great, satisfaction is also important. According to Socialnomics.net,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/reneheyer/2013-hotelmarketingtrends"" target=""_blank"">33 percent of travelers</a> report changing their hotel after reading a negative comment about the location on Facebook. So before that happens, it's important to know how to find a great deal at a great place.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Understand (and Avoid) Fees</h2>
<p>Hidden money is only good when it's in your bank account. When it comes in the form of fees and taxes you weren't expecting, your bargain hotel can turn into a bust when the bill increases by 20 percent. Years ago, hotels could count on pulling a profit from phone charges. Now that most travelers carry their own, many of these establishments are looking for new sources of revenue. Enter the grounds fee, <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/videos/travel/2014/02/14/5388271/"" target=""_blank"">resort fee</a>, towel fee, and more. Here are a few suggestions on how to avoid exorbitant hotel taxes and fees:</p>
<h3>Check into Check-in and Check-Out&nbsp;</h3>
<p>While some hotels are flexible with check-in and check-out times, most are not. Some will charge you if you check in early so make sure you verify this before doing so. If you arrive early, ask if you can store your luggage free of charge. Most hotels will store it for you, but be aware that it's not always free. The only way to know is to ask.</p>
<p>Many vacationers check out leisurely with no attention to hotel policy. Some hotels charge for late check-outs if you don't vacate the room by a certain time (usually 11:00 a.m). Make sure you ask before assuming check-out is at your discretion.</p>
<h3>Understand Cancellations and Early Departure Fees</h3>
<p>Most hotels will penalize you for cancelling a reservation even 72 hours before occupancy. Make sure you understand the cancellation policy, so you don't end up paying for a room you don't end up using. Some last-minute deals are completely non-refundable, so make sure you read the fine print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, don't assume that, if you've shortened your vacation plans, you can just casually tell the hotel upon check-in. Some hotels charge early departure fees for last-minute changes. Knowing your hotel's policy will help you to avoid such items.</p>
<h3>Figure Out Parking</h3>
<p>Metropolitan and resort hotels may charge for parking, and the costs can sometimes be considerable. Research the area's parking situation, especially if you don't plan to leave the resort, before committing to something that could cost up to $50 a day plus tip.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Understand What's Included</h3>
<p>Some hotels may add fees for housekeeping, spa, gym, and newspapers, even if you don't actually use them. Find out at check-in if this is the case. If it is, ask if you can opt out of these services and the fees associated with them.</p>
<p>Some hotels offer free WiFi, others include it in the resort fee, and other will even charge you a daily fee. Make sure you're clear about the charges on a second device if you've brought a laptop and a tablet, or if you are travelling with others who have devices. Even hotels that offer free WiFi may charge you for a second device in your room. Check-out is not the time to discover this.</p>

<h2>Find the Best Deal at U.S. Hotels</h2>
<p>Now that you understand fees and how best to avoid them, it's time to look into finding a cheap place to stay. If you're vacationing in the United States, you'll want to:</p>
<h3>Compare Prices Online</h3>
<p>Finding an inexpensive hotel is easy with help from the Internet. Sites like Hipmunk&nbsp;check multiple discounters at once such as Expedia, Priceline.com, Hotels.com, Airbnb, Booking.com, Get a Room, Orbitz, and Travelocity, which will save you time and money. Finding the best price is just a couple of clicks away.</p>
<p>Some membership organizations like <a href=""http://autoclubsouth.aaa.com/travel/travel.aspx?Link_Source=travel&amp;From_Page=AAA.com&amp;cid=DeepLink_Travel&amp;zip=33604&amp;devicecd=PC&amp;referer=travel.aaa.com"" target=""_blank"">AAA</a>, AARP, the American Bar Association, and the American Medical Association offer hotel discounts as well. Discounts based on your military involvement or government employment may also be available.</p>
<h3>Avoid High Season Travel</h3>
<p>No matter where you go, there are high seasons and low seasons based on local weather and events. For instance, high season in Florida extends from November until April and June through September (when kids are out of school and vacations to the amusement parks are at their peak). Travelling to this area during either of those times will be expensive. If, however, you select the shoulder season before it cools off up north, and when kids are in school, you're more likely to avoid bloated room rates and fees.</p>
<p>Travel to Europe is less expensive in winter, and yet it's a very beautiful time to enjoy the holiday festivals and decorations. As a bonus, you'll also experience smaller crowds than if you planned a holiday in August.</p>
<p>If you're not flexible with the season in which you travel, you can still master the deal by being aware of peak days. For instance, if you're travelling to a city that largely empties out on the weekend, weekend hotel rates will be less expensive than the higher travelled work week. The opposite is true as well. For locations that don't receive a lot of business travelers, you're likely to secure lower rom rates during the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do your research on the most popular seasons and days to travel to the area. Select a less crowded time, and your hotel rates will most likely be lower as well.</p>
<h3>Understand Less Expensive Hotels May Provide More</h3>
<p>When pricing hotel rooms, it's important not only to understand the hidden fees but <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2013/03/06/how-to-get-the-best-hotel-deals/"" target=""_blank"">calculate</a> what's included in the room price as well. Hipmunk provides you with a list of amenities, fees, and surcharges so you can better understand what you're getting and how you're paying for it.</p>
<p>Does your room come with breakfast? A paper? Gym access? Coffee? Internet? Often the less expensive chains with the budget traveler in mind offer more inclusions for a lower room rate. For instance, the Fairfield Inn by Marriott includes Internet, breakfast, coffee, and newspaper with the room; while its sister properties under the JW Marriott brand do not.</p>
<p>Don't fall prey to making a decision based on included items unless they are truly things you would be paying for - like breakfast.</p>
<h3>Join a Loyalty Program</h3>
<p>If you find yourself partial to a hotel chain, joining its loyalty program will keep you advised of deals and offers. Some send weekly emails of deeply discounted last-minute rates at specific locations.</p>
<p>If you're not a member of a loyalty program, but you've stayed at that particular location before, mention it. They may offer you a past guest rate. If you work for a large company, even if you're not on a business trip, say so. The hotel chain may have a rate agreement with your employer that is sometimes lower than published rates.</p>
<h3>Check for Last-Minute Travel Bargains</h3>
<p>If you're travel plans are coming together at the last minute, you may find a hotel willing to discount its room in order to get it filled. The property may also be willing to offer added services or waive fees if you ask. This tactic is best used for shorter stays and times when hotels need to fill rooms.</p>
<h3>Forego Location</h3>
<p>While it's important to find a hotel in a safe area, sometimes booking a few blocks over, or a metro stop away, will save you hundreds. For instance, staying in New Jersey costs approximately half of what it does to stay in downtown Manhattan and many New Jersey locations are a quick train ride away.</p>
<p>If you plan to use your hotel as a home base for sleeping only, and will spend most of your time sightseeing, location may be less important than price and a worthwhile exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Get a Deal at a Luxury/5-Star or Boutique Hotel</h2>
<p>The above advice applies to luxury properties as well. In addition to those suggestions, try these to land the best deal at a 5-star location:</p>
<h3>Master the Ask</h3>
<p>Paying for the least expensive room at a luxury resort and then asking upon check-in if an upgrade is possible is a great way to score a better room for a lower price. Many of the most economical rooms sell out and hotels overbook them. When this occurs, they need to make other arrangements. Asking for the upgrade is an easy way to get it.</p>
<p>This generally works better at hotels that reach maximum capacity and/or if you're checking in after 6 p.m. since they have a more concrete understanding of who is keeping their reservation. However, if you are able to connect with the front desk attendant, she may&nbsp;accommodate your request even if the room category is not sold out.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Check in Late</h3>
<p>Busy hotels overbook because many guests never show. Occasionally, everyone who made&nbsp;a reservation shows up. When this happens during the busy season, guests who show up later for check-in may not have the room they requested. This is a gamble, as it could lead to either an upgrade or a room at another property. Either way, you may end up getting a superior room for a discounted price.</p>
<h3>Look at Packages</h3>
<p>Some luxury resort packages, or special weekend promotions, are less expensive than their flat room rates. Check these out on their website. If you're flying or combining a hotel stay with another type of vacation, like a cruise for instance, you may be able to secure lower hotel rates when booking car, cruise, flight and/or hotel together.</p>
<h3>Know When to Look</h3>
<p>Room rates generally drop closer to check-in date and can save you as much as 30-40 percent if you wait until the last minute. However, particularly in the case of a boutique or trendy hotel, sell outs and lack of room variety are the downside to waiting. If you are travelling alone, or with someone you don't mind sharing a bed with, waiting may be your best option for getting a deep discount.</p>
<p>If, however, you are travelling with a family of four or more, the best time to book your room is 14-21 days out. You'll still most likely receive a good price and there will be enough variety to suit your needs.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to every rule and Chicago is&nbsp;one. Rates for hotels in Chicago tend to increase as check-in approaches. So if you're planning a trip to the Windy City, booking in advance is suggested for the best rate.</p>
<h3>Take Advantage of Renovations</h3>
<p>If you know you'll be spending very little time in your room, you can secure a great deal on hotels that are undergoing renovation or have recently been renovated. The downsides are noise, clutter, and dust, but if the hotel is not a major part of your vacation plans and sightseeing is, it's worth it.</p>
<h3>Get to Know the Budget Boutique Collections</h3>
<p>If you have a taste for the good life, but a wallet that doesn't agree, the <a href=""http://smithhotels.com/budget-boutique-hotels?from_site_region=uk#_ga=1.123759114.104789147.1398872830"" target=""_blank"">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith Budget Boutique Hotels Collection</a> is perfect for you. With locations in various spots across the United States and the World, this chain of hotels provides superb service and charming romantic rooms. They are chic and come with indulgent extras that usually carry a very high price tag, like fresh flowers in the rooms or champagne upon arrival.</p>
<p>If you're interested in checking out the deals at this chain, Hipmunk can search the city of your choosing and filter by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith.</p>
<h2>Visit Cheap Destinations</h2>
<p>If you're looking for inexpensive lodging and you're flexible about destination, you can find some excellent deals in the following cities:</p>
<h3>Cape Town, South Africa</h3>
<p>If you can swing the airfare, hotel prices at this exotic destination are down 8 percent this year. Cape Town's 3-star&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.hipmunk.com/hotel/Cape-Town-South-Africa/Parliament-Hotel-509bfe9c66edc84661022a24?product=1&amp;check_in=2014-05-02&amp;check_out=2014-05-04&amp;hotel_pax=2&amp;rooms=1&amp;country=US&amp;language=en"" target=""_blank"">Parliament Hote</a><a href=""http://www.hipmunk.com/hotel/Cape-Town-South-Africa/Parliament-Hotel-509bfe9c66edc84661022a24?product=1&amp;check_in=2014-05-02&amp;check_out=2014-05-04&amp;hotel_pax=2&amp;rooms=1&amp;country=US&amp;language=en"" target=""_blank"">l's</a> rates begin at an affordable $62 a night with free parking and free WiFi.</p>
<h3>Venice, Italy</h3>
<p>Another locale with dipping hotel prices is Venice, Italy. Prices are down 7 percent from 2013 so now is a great time to explore this opulent city.</p>
<h3>Orlando, Fla.</h3>
<p>A playground for the young and old, Orlando offers an economical hotel scene. Many hotels offer free kid's meals and transportation to and from the parks. If you're willing to stay in nearby Kissimmee (just a few exits down I-4), you can cut your hotel bill by 40 percent.</p>
<h3>Warsaw, Poland</h3>
<p>The ultimate discount destination, Warsaw hotel prices are 20 percent lower in 2014 than they were last year. Old Town offers cheap eats, including a dish of traditional pierogies (7) that costs about $4.50 at&nbsp;Pierogarnia na Bednarskiej, a local restaurant.&nbsp;Ibis Budget Warszawa Reduta's rooms are small but stylishly appointed. The price will make you smile because they start at $49 a night.</p>
<h2>Explore the Alternatives</h2>
<p>You don't have to be a daring adventurer to try some of the economical alternatives to hotels. From rooms in private homes to vacation rentals to youth hostels, there are many amazing deals to be had for those who explore alternative lodging options.</p>
<h3>Room Renting</h3>
<p>Hipmunk's hotel search also features lodging alternatives like those found on <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/"" target=""_blank"">Airbnb</a>. These rooms, which may or may not have shared common areas and bathrooms, may cost as little as $50 a night - a great savings in metropolitan hot spots. In addition to offering very affordable accommodations, your host can give a local's view of the area, providing you with information on the best spots from someone who lives there.</p>
<h3>Hostels</h3>
<p>While their reputation is one of backpacking college students sleeping dormitory style, many hostels offer private rooms as well with a price tag that's the equivalent of a low-end hotel. Hostels are generally busy places with lots of commotion. Some are located in questionable areas so do your research before booking one. If it's a member of <a href=""https://www.hihostels.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hostelling International</a>, the site must meet cleanliness and safety standards.</p>
<h3>Vacation Rentals</h3>
<p>Vacation rentals come in all shapes and sizes. Some have minimum stays required during high season (which can be as little as two days or as long as a week) so make sure you understand the requirements before booking. They are generally more spacious than hotel rooms and often offer kitchens or kitchenettes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they can be a little pricey for the lone or coupled traveler, they are ideal for those who are travelling with families. Some vacation rentals are large enough for extended families to split the costs. In addition, being able to eat at the rental will save you money on dining out. You can even do laundry at some places.</p>
<p>Vacation rentals require a rental agreement, so if your plans may change, a hotel will suit you better.</p>
<p>Getting away is a lot more relaxing if you're not worrying about your hotel bill. Travelling on a budget doesn't mean giving up luxury but it does mean doing your homework: from understanding fees to scouting the best deals, the work you put into designing your dream vacation will pay off in savings.</p>"
