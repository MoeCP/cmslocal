Write about 3 to 6 ways a homeowner saves money through preventive maintenance on their HVAC units. Homeowners aren&#039;t always thinking about the condition of their HVAC units. They turn a switch and the AC or heat comes on. Sometimes, it doesn&#039;t at all, leaving the home too hot or cool. Talk about things such as how air quality equals healthy residents and fewer medical bills. Consider anchoring the URL to a sentence that discusses having a service contract for maintenance and taking advantage of it to save on the cost of repairs and replacements.
