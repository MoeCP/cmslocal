In the dropbox link provided you will find both the IG and an already written introduction. Your directions are to make that pre-written introduction into a 200-300 word unique intro for the IG. You can use what is already written as a reference to write your own, or you can revise/re-word the pre-written intro to be unique (it must be unique). The intro you are writing must naturally include the AT and URL provided.  Do not make subheads. This is an introduction.
