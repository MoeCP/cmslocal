 makes dollars it makes sense and this was no less true in the case of the recent
 acquisition of Dash Navigation by RIM.   According to an article published by GPS
 Business News, RIM (Research in Motion), a  Canadian telecommunications company
 best know as the developer of the BlackBerry Smartphone, acquired struggling Dash
 Technologies for an undisclosed sum, according to experts in the field, such as
 Dominique Bonte, it was around 7 million.   This acquisition now allows the BlackBerry
 maker the technology to provide real-time traffic information and state of the 
art GPS mapping solutions for all it\u8217\'92s Smartphone users. \par}

Navigation was the maker of GPS Dash Express, an Internet-connected GPS system, 
that provided up to date traffic information and state of the art destination software
.  According to the Boy Genius Report, Dash has had trouble selling it\u8217\'92
s navigation unit and has been laying off staffers and has ceased production of 
it\u8217\'92s hardware solution, The Dash Express.  While the company had stopped
 making hardware units, the company would continue to license it\u8217\'92s software
 to hardware and mobile manufacturers.  Being that Dash is in financial turmoil, 
and RIM\u8217\'92s current mapping/GPS solutions leaves a lot to be desired, it 
was a win-win.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\tab According
 to Bonte, one of the main reasons for this merger was tax breaks.  Dash was looking
 for a significant break in their tax output and teaming up with RIM makes sense
 for both parties.  Dash can get a break on their corporate tax plan and RIM acquires
 a much needed GPS technology so they can better compete with other brands that 
have already acquired this technology like Nokia and Garmin.  This deal looks great
 on paper for both sides and is necessary for RIM to compete in the global conflagration
 that has become mobile technology. \par}

 impact are these corporate mergers, built out necessity having on our American 
business climate.  How many jobs are being shipped overseas as American companies
 are failing to compete with the rest of the world technologically.  Take Japan 
for instance.  According to Pandab newsletter, an online newsletter summarizing 
top news articles on privacy, law and business, this lack of innovation on our part
 is a serious economic threat to the United States.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\tab Because
 Japan\u8217\'92s banking, political, and social systems are showing signs of serious
 trouble recently their economic future depends largely on their ability to obtain
 early access to new technology.  In the past, Japan has always obtained new and
 important technology from other countries.  Japan technological economy tends to
 focus on innovation rather than inventiveness, causing problems to the U.S. which
 tends to be the other way around.  Japanese companies are obtaining patents at 
a record pace, and driving out American companies reducing our export competitiveness
 and damaging our balance of trade.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\tab What 
happens when the global demand for new technology becomes so high that we can no
 longer keep up with the competition.  America, during the 20{\super th} century
, rose to dominance on account of it\u8217\'92s technological superiority.  But 
in the last 20 years alone we have seen this greatly diminish.  Japan\u8217\'92s
 technological superiority in many modern technologies, like cars, electronics, 
and green technology, is now well recognized.  As global demand rises more jobs 
will be shipped overseas, more American companies will go out of business, and America
 could lose it\u8217\'92s economic advantage.  \par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\tab The impact
 of organizational culture on mergers can have profound implications in real world
 markets.  Just because a merger looks good on paper doesn\u8217\'92t mean it will
 always be successful.  Some merger effects can be extremely positive, as evidenced
 in the cases of Wal-Mart, UPS, and Southwest.  However, errors in judgment when
 merging large companies can be colossal.  Especially when they\u8217\'92re made
 out of desperation. Take the ill-fated merger of Time Warner and American Online
 in 2001.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\tab In 2001
, at the height of the dot-com boom, the marriage between these two companies seemed
 like a match made in heaven.  AOL was valued at more than 150 Billion when the 
ill-fated merger was announced, but it\u8217\'92s worth collapsed dramatically as
 the dot-com bubble burst.  Time Warner had to end up selling of AOL and lost over
 40 Billion in the process making this one of the worst corporate mergers on record
.\par}

\pard\nowidctlpar\nooverflow\sl240\slmult1{\f0\lang1033\fs24\kerning28\tab As technology
 advances and becomes more sophisticated global demand will only skyrocket further
.  If America wants to maintain it\u8217\'92s economic superiority well into the
 21{\super st} century it needs to become a more innovative force and offer companies
 more incentives not to ship jobs overseas.  As this new Industrial Revolution continues
 to exceed all of our imaginations the implications can be either a great success
 for America, or a crippling failure.  Only time will tell what implications mergers
 like RIM and Dash technologies will have on our society and our economic future
 as a whole.\par}
